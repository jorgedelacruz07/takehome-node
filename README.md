## About the library

I used _csv-parse_ as a CSV's library because provide a _stream.Transform_ API for Node.js. It's so easy to use and powerful. A lot of people help to improve this library and has almost 3 millon weekly downloads.

I used _axios_ to get information from remote url. It's the best alternative to fetch data from remote url's.
